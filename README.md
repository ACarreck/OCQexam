# OCQexam

Hello, thank you for considering me as an aplicant. This is the source code for my submission.

Hopefully you have already seen this hosted on my server, but if not there is a link in the email I submitted this with 
(this is publicly hosted, it's best if I don't give out the IP)

If you would like to run this code from source you can excute start.sh from an ubuntu bash terminal

This will launch a flask webserver on localhost:5000 and you can then use the code with the interface

(this project uses python 3.10 for the *Amazing* addition of a switch statement ***finally***)
